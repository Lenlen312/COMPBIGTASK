<center><h1>St. Marie Eugenie Milleret</h1></center>
<center><h2>Anne Eugenie Milleret, later to become Sr. Marie Eugenie of Jesus foundress of the Religious of the Assumption, was born in Metz in northern France in 1817.</br> 
Her family was privileged, wealthy, politically involved, and irreligious. She was baptised, however, and her first communion at the age of twelve was an extraordinary spiritual experience.</br>
As she returned from the altar rails, worried that she would not find her mother in the crowd, she heard a voice within her saying: you will lose your mother, but I shall be for you more than a mother. </br>
A day will come when you will leave everything you love in order to glorify me and serve this Church that you do not know. And that was how it was.</br> 
When she was thirteen a reversal in family fortunes saw her fatherâ€™s bankruptcy, the separation of her parents and the departure of Anne Eugenie to Paris with her mother. </br>
Two years later her mother died of cholera after only a few hours of illness and at the age of fifteen Anne Eugenie was alone. She was boarded out with different families and although outwardly she was happy enough, inwardly she was miserable.</br></center></h2>
